	Lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong wrote this when his girlfriend moved to Ecuador. He tried to be levelheaded about it, but to show his 
	anger, he named the song "Good Riddance" and made "Time Of Your Life" the subtitle. The song shows us about life, how we are not to 
	question it and keep moving on.

	Lead singer Chris Martin has said that the lyrics are about being devoted to someone, wanting to do anything for them: writing a song

	someone that you look up to and would do anything for, a brotherly love. He claims to have had no specific person in mind when he

	"The Scientist" is a song by British rock band Coldplay. The song was written collaboratively by all the band members for their second
	album, A Rush of Blood to the Head. It is built around a piano ballad, with lyrics telling the story about a man's desire to love and 
	an apology.
	Chris Martin said this song is based on his "disasters with girls." In a track-by-track reveal, he explained the development of the 
	song: "That's just about girls. It's weird that whatever else is on your mind, whether it's the downfall of global economics or 
	terrible environmental troubles, the thing that always gets you most is when you fancy someone."

	"Fix You" is a song by the British rock band Coldplay. It was written by all four members of the band for their third studio album,
	X&Y (2005). It was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X&Y and reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart.
	This song deals with true love, helping someone in your time of need, and learning from your mistakes. Coldplay lead singer 
	Chris Martin hasn't spoken about the specific inspiration for the song, but it could be directed to his wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, who was
	dealing with the death of her father in 2002. In USA Today, Martin did say where the song started: "My father-in-law Bruce Paltrow 
	bought this big keyboard just before he died. No one had ever plugged it in. I plugged it in, and there was this incredible sound I'd 
	never heard before. All these songs poured out from this one sound. Something has to inspire you, and something else takes over. It's 
	very cloudy."

	on the same day as the movie’s theater debut on July 19th, 2019.
	In the “Grand Escape” by Radwimps, it is brought to question if it’s impossible to let two different worlds overlap. Be it the sky and 
	earth, or the summer to fall, are they not allowed to be together? Love tells us to take the opportunity to go forth. To not let the 
	horizon, or this society, be the last destination. That we may be fearful or will have to take detours… but we have to “go.”

	A dear question is asked with “Is There Still Anything That Love Can Do” by Radwimps, when faced with a world that can seem so grey 
	and cold. One feels so drowned in such an objective era of winners, where even the gods seem to have averted their gaze. But to the 
	singer… they’ve received so much from their significant other. So much that it has granted them an indomitable and everlasting will. 
	So, in return, he wants to make it known that there is still something that love can do… something that he can do for his beloved, 
	with the magic of courage, hope and bonds…

	“Celebration” by Radwimps brings together a festive song, as the singer rejoices in receiving energy in their once meaningless life.
	With a simple “good morning,” they’ve been empowered as if riled up by a passionate speech. The singer only believes they can fulfill
	their question. And as they strive to express their joy, they ask if their savior will answer back with what they desire…
